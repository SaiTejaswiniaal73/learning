    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>
    <h6>"Chicken Biryani" is a fragrant, layered rice dish made with marinated chicken, basmati rice, and a blend of aromatic spices. The chicken is usually marinated in yogurt and spices like cumin, coriander, garam masala, and sometimes saffron, then cooked until tender. Parboiled rice is layered over the chicken, and the whole dish is slow-cooked to allow the flavors to meld together.</h6>
