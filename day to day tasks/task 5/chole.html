    <h1>Chole</h1>
    <h6>"Chole Curry" is a spicy, flavorful Indian curry made with chickpeas (known as chole or chana in Hindi) simmered in a thick, tangy tomato-onion gravy. The curry is seasoned with a mix of spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala, along with chole masala, which gives it a distinctive flavor. Originating from North India, chole curry is often paired with rice, puri, or bhature, making it a satisfying and popular vegetarian dish across India.</h6>
