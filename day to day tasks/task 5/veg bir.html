    <h1>Vegetable Biryani</h1>
    <h6>"Vegetable Biryani" is a popular Indian rice dish made with basmati rice, mixed vegetables, and aromatic spices. The word "biryani" originates from the Persian word birian, meaning "fried before cooking," and typically involves layering partially cooked rice with spiced vegetables (or sometimes meat) and slow-cooking them together. The result is a flavorful, fragrant dish where each grain of rice absorbs the spices, making it a favorite vegetarian main course across India and beyond.</h6>
